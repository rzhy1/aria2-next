# ED2K/eMule Reference Alignment Progress

This file is the compact chronological evidence trail for the ED2K/eMule
reference-alignment refactor.

Use this format:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD RAx status
Changed: concise tracker, code, or behavior summary.
Verified: exact final command and result, or documentation-only reason.
Remaining: next concrete gap.
Blocked: none, or exact blocker.
```

Keep entries checkpoint-sized. Do not record every investigation step, ordinary
build, small parser edit, raw public-network log, packet capture, generated
report, local cache, or conversation summary.

## Log

2026-05-19 RA0 verified
Changed: Replaced the previous active ED2K refactor tracker with a new
reference-alignment tracker. The new tracker separates the progress index,
reference ledger, domain checkpoint files, and compact progress log. It changes
the goal from public-network download completion to authoritative reference
alignment, protocol truth, maintainable ownership, and compact local
verification.
Verified: `git diff --check docs/maintenance` passed. CSV consistency checks
passed for `checkpoint-index.csv`, `reference-ledger.csv`, and every
`checkpoints/*.csv` file.
Remaining: Start RA1 current implementation ownership audit.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA1 verified
Changed: Audited the current ED2K implementation surface and recorded the
source inventory in `overview.md`. The audit maps focused helper modules,
RequestGroup-owned state, TCP command ownership, UDP/Kad ownership, sharing,
upload, session, RPC, documentation, and local test coverage. It also records
the immediate capability-truth risk around advertised eMule peer info and the
main maintainability risk in `Ed2kCommand.cc` and `Ed2kKadCommand.cc`.
Verified: Focused `rg` and `sed` inspection of ED2K source, integration, and
test files; `git diff --check docs/maintenance`; CSV consistency check for all
`docs/maintenance/ed2k-refactor` CSV files.
Remaining: Start RA2 authoritative reference mapping against amule-official,
emule-official-0.50a, mldonkey-official, wireshark-official, and protocol-docs.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA2 verified
Changed: Completed the authoritative reference map. `overview.md` now records
the concrete reference entry points for aMule, eMule 0.50a, MLDonkey,
Wireshark, and protocol-docs. `reference-ledger.csv` remains the scope ledger
for port, adapt, replace, and prune decisions; domain rows stay pending until
their implementation checkpoints prove alignment.
Verified: Focused `find`, `rg`, and `sed` inspection of the authoritative
reference set; `git diff --check docs/maintenance`; CSV consistency check for
all `docs/maintenance/ed2k-refactor` CSV files.
Remaining: Start RA10 link and metadata alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA10 verified
Changed: Aligned ED2K link and file identity parsing with the authoritative
aMule/eMule link behavior. File names now normalize path separators before
output path selection, file sizes reject values at or above the eMule/aMule
2^38 byte limit, empty part-hash lists are rejected, and `search` links parse
as metadata without becoming normal downloads. Updated the RA10 checkpoint and
reference ledger.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1093)`.
Remaining: Start RA11 metadata file and persistence alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA11 verified
Changed: Aligned metadata file import and persistence ownership. `server.met`
parsing now preserves operational tags for users, files, limits, UDP flags,
LowID users, UDP key, obfuscation ports, and dynip hostnames into native
ServerState. `nodes.dat` parsing now filters unusable and Kad1-only contacts
and applies the aMule/eMule verified-contact fallback for bootstrap files.
Legacy part.met, known.met, known2.met, and clients.met remain replaced by
aria2-next control files, hidden session state, SharedStore, and UploadQueue
ownership.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1093)`.
Remaining: Start RA20 server TCP alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA20 verified
Changed: Aligned ED2K server TCP handling with the authoritative references.
Classic `OP_GETSOURCES` keeps hash-plus-size payloads, TCP status no longer
clears UDP-only server metadata, IDChange accepts extension tails, server ident
updates name and description, server-list and server-ident parsers tolerate
trailing data, and malformed FoundSources or search result packets finish the
current request without marking the server failed.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1093)`. `git diff --check`
passed.
Remaining: Start RA21 server UDP alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA21 verified
Changed: Aligned ED2K server UDP and callback state. UDP status replies now
clear matched challenges and accept reference-style extension tails. Packed UDP
source replies preserve valid sources when later packets are unrelated or have
bogus trailing bytes. Server-mediated LowID callback remains supported while
buddy-only and direct UDP callback ownership stay pruned until a later
checkpoint proves they are required.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1093)`.
Remaining: Start RA30 peer hello and capability truth.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA30 verified
Changed: Aligned peer hello capability truth against aMule, eMule, and
Wireshark. Local ED2K peer capability construction now lives in
`ed2k_peer.*` and is shared by active-download and shared-only peer commands.
Hello packets advertise implemented AICH, Unicode, compression, Source
Exchange, and large-file support. Multipacket, extended multipacket, crypt,
secure identification, Kad, and file identifiers remain unadvertised until
their packet and state paths are complete. Standalone eMule info keeps the
reference-compatible legacy tag shape.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1094)`.
Remaining: Start RA31 modern peer request flow.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA31 verified
Changed: Closed the modern peer request-flow alignment audit. The current
plain fallback flow matches the authoritative aMule/eMule request sequence:
request filename with extended metadata, request file status for multi-part
files, request and parse hashsets with the reference hash-plus-count payload,
ask Source Exchange and AICH through separate eMule packets, start upload
through `OP_STARTUPLOADREQ`, and handle accept, queue-rank, no-file, filename,
status, hashset, AICH, and Source Exchange responses through the native peer
and shared-responder paths. Multipacket, extended multipacket, file identifier,
`OP_HASHSETREQUEST2`, and `OP_HASHSETANSWER2` remain disabled because RA30
keeps those local capability bits unadvertised.
Verified: Focused inspection against aMule `DownloadClient.cpp`,
`ClientTCPSocket.cpp`, `KnownFile.cpp`, eMule `UploadClient.cpp`,
`FileIdentifier.cpp`, `opcodes.h`, Wireshark ED2K dissector notes, and current
`Ed2kCommand.cc`, `Ed2kSharedResponder.*`, and `ed2k_peer.*`. No code changed,
so no C++ test run was needed for this checkpoint.
Remaining: Start RA32 peer transfer control and failure state.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA32 verified
Changed: Aligned peer transfer-control boundaries and failure state. The
current peer path validates normal and compressed part packet hash, range, and
length before disk writes, clears requested ranges on disconnect, cancel,
out-of-parts, no-file, bad packet, corrupt piece, and duplicate endpoint
replacement paths, and sends failed peers into PeerState retry/backoff without
halting unrelated sources. Added a protocol-boundary guard so 32-bit
`OP_REQUESTPARTS` payloads reject offsets above `UINT32_MAX`; large offsets use
the existing I64 request path.
Verified: The new `Ed2kHelperTest::testProtocolPayloads` assertion failed
before the guard because 32-bit request payloads accepted a 4 GiB offset. After
the fix, `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed and
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1094)`.
Remaining: Start RA40 disk transfer and integrity alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA40 verified
Changed: Aligned ED2K MD4 hashset boundaries with the authoritative aMule and
eMule model. Hashset request and validation now use the ED2K theoretical
part-hash count instead of aria2 data-piece count. Files smaller than
`PARTSIZE` return no hashset entries. Exact `PARTSIZE` multiples request and
validate the reference trailing empty MD4 hash. Shared-file import and hashset
responses use the same boundary rules.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1095)`. `git diff --check`
passed.
Remaining: Start RA50 source policy and Source Exchange alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA50 verified
Changed: Aligned source policy and Source Exchange capability truth. Source
Exchange requests now choose `OP_REQUESTSOURCES2` only for SX2 peers, choose
hash-only `OP_REQUESTSOURCES` only for SX1 peers with version greater than 1,
and skip unsupported peers. Require-crypt source endpoints remain preserved as
metadata but no longer enter normal peer connect scheduling while encrypted
transport is unimplemented.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed.
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1095)`. `git diff --check`
passed.
Remaining: Start RA51 Kad alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA51 verified
Changed: Aligned Kad routing and publish behavior with the authoritative
aMule/eMule/Wireshark references. Kad now answers bootstrap requests with
filtered closest contacts, excludes the requester when possible, uses the
configured ED2K TCP port in Kad hello, bootstrap, firewalled-check, and publish
paths, completes bootstrap transactions, answers targeted `KAD_REQ` lookups,
responds to `KAD_PING`, rejects unusable Kad routing contacts, and publishes
large-file HighID sources with source type 4. Kad1 and UI-only Kad behavior
remain pruned.
Verified: The large-file publish assertion failed before the source-type fix
with expected 4 and actual 1. After the fix, `git diff --check` passed,
`cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed, and
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1096)`.
Remaining: Start RA60 sharing upload and credits alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA60 verified
Changed: Closed sharing, upload queue, and credit alignment. The shared-file
store and responder already matched the non-pruned reference surface for
completed/imported file metadata, disk validation, filename/status/hashset,
Source Exchange, AICH, and part serving. UploadQueue now also rejects a second
queue entry with the same 16-byte user hash, matching the aMule/eMule duplicate
identity guard without importing secure-ident or GUI queue policy.
Verified: The new `Ed2kSharedStoreTest::testUploadQueueRejectsDuplicateUserHash`
failed before the UploadQueue guard because two endpoints with the same user
hash could occupy the queue. After the fix, `cmake --build --preset default
--target aria2_tests` passed and `build/default/aria2_tests` passed with
`OK (1097)`. `git diff --check` passed.
Remaining: Start RA70 search RPC and Motrix alignment.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA70 verified
Changed: Closed search, RPC, and Motrix field alignment. Existing server/Kad
search transport, result deduplication, local filters, merged source counts,
complete source counts, generated `ed2kLink`, boolean `moreResults`, and nested
ED2K `tellStatus` fields already matched the non-pruned tracker surface.
Search result metadata parsing now also maps the legacy named media codec tag
`codec` into `mediaCodec`, matching the aMule/eMule metadata conversion path.
The tracker path for the manual was corrected to `docs/manual/en/aria2-next.rst`.
Verified: The new `Ed2kHelperTest::testSearchResultPayload` assertion failed
before the parser fix because `mediaCodec` was empty for a named `codec` tag.
After the fix, `cmake --build --preset default --target aria2_tests` passed and
`build/default/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1097)`.
Remaining: Start RA71 documentation and final local audit.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-19 RA71 verified
Changed: Closed the documentation and final local audit checkpoint. Manual,
RPC, completion, and maintenance tracker wording was checked against the
implemented ED2K behavior and pruned limitations. The overview now records the
verified final refactor state instead of RA1-era pending wording.
Verified: Under `conda activate global`, regenerated bash completion from the
current `build/default/aria2-next --help=#all` output matched
`docs/completion/aria2-next`, `bash -n docs/completion/aria2-next` passed, and
the public ED2K options were present in help output. `cmake --preset default`
passed. `cmake --build --preset default` passed with the local Tcl/Tk search
path linker warning. `ctest --preset default` passed with `100% tests passed, 0
tests failed out of 1`. `build/default/aria2-next --version` passed and
reported `Aria2 Next version 2.0.6` with `OpenSSL/3.6.2`.
Remaining: none.
Blocked: none.
