# Android ARM64 Package Note

This package contains the Aria2 Next `aria2-next` binary for Android ARM64. It is a native command-line executable, not an Android application package.

The binary is built with the Android NDK and statically linked release dependencies recorded in `packaging/dependencies.env` in the source tree. The official release binary is checked before packaging so it does not require `libc++_shared.so`.

Example use from an Android shell environment:

```sh
chmod 755 ./aria2-next
./aria2-next --version
./aria2-next http://127.0.0.1:18080/file.iso
```

Android certificate paths differ across shells and devices. Pass `--ca-certificate` explicitly when the shell environment does not expose usable defaults.

Android release smoke testing is local and does not depend on external network downloads. Runtime HTTPS behavior depends on the CA path visible to the shell environment.
