Technical Notes
===============

This document describes additional technical information for Aria2 Next. The
expected audience is developers.

Control File (\*.aria2) Format
------------------------------

The control file uses a binary format to store progress information of
a download. Here is the diagram for each field:

.. code-block:: text

     0                   1                   2                   3

            |                                                       |

                    Repeated in (NUM IN-FLIGHT) PIECE times

``VER`` (VERSION): 2 bytes
   Should be either version 0(0x0000) or version 1(0x0001).  In
   version 1, all multi-byte integers are saved in network byte
   order(big endian).  In version 0, all multi-byte integers are saved
   in host byte order.  Aria2 Next can read both versions and only
   writes a control file in version 1 format.  version 0 support will
   be disappear in the future version.

``EXT`` (EXTENSION): 4 bytes
   If LSB is 1(i.e. ``EXT[3]&1 == 1``), Aria2 Next checks whether the saved
   InfoHash and current downloading one are the same. If they are not
   the same, an exception is thrown. This is called "infoHashCheck"
   extension.

``INFO HASH LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of InfoHash that is located after this field. If
   "infoHashCheck" extension is enabled, if this value is 0, then an
   exception is thrown. For http/ftp downloads, this value should be
   0.

``INFO HASH``: ``(INFO HASH LENGTH)`` bytes
   BitTorrent InfoHash.

``PIECE LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of the piece.

``TOTAL LENGTH``: 8 bytes
   The total length of the download.

``UPLOAD LENGTH``: 8 bytes
   The uploaded length in this download.

``BITFIELD LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of bitfield.

``BITFIELD``: ``(BITFIELD LENGTH)`` bytes
   This is the bitfield which represents current download progress.

``NUM IN-FLIGHT PIECE``: 4 bytes
   The number of in-flight pieces. These piece is not marked
   'downloaded' in the bitfield, but it has at least one downloaded
   chunk.

The following 4 fields are repeated in ``(NUM IN-FLIGHT PIECE)``
times.

``INDEX``: 4 bytes
   The index of the piece.

``LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of the piece.

``PIECE BITFIELD LENGTH``: 4 bytes
   The length of bitfield of this piece.

``PIECE BITFIELD``: ``(PIECE BITFIELD LENGTH)`` bytes
   The bitfield of this piece. The each bit represents 16KiB chunk.

BitTorrent DHT state
--------------------

Aria2 Next uses libtorrent-rasterbar as its BitTorrent backend.
BitTorrent DHT routing state is owned by libtorrent and is not stored in
the removed native ``dht.dat`` or ``dht6.dat`` formats.

JSON-RPC extension fields
-------------------------

Aria2 Next keeps aria2-compatible JSON-RPC fields where they can represent
state accurately. When a modern backend exposes state that cannot be represented
without placeholders, Aria2 Next adds explicit extension fields.

For libtorrent magnet tasks, ``bittorrent.metadata`` reports metadata phase.
``bittorrent.info`` is omitted until real torrent metadata is available.

For ED2K tasks, ``ed2k.visibleCompletedLength`` exposes stable user-facing
progress across active, waiting, paused, and stopped states.

HTTP Range validation
---------------------

The libcurl-backed HTTP path validates ranged responses before body writes.
Ranged segment writes require ``206 Partial Content``, a matching
``Content-Range``, and identity content encoding. Servers that ignore Range and
return ``200 OK`` can be treated as range-unreliable and restarted as a
single full-body transfer.
