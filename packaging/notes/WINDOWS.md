# Windows Package Note

This package contains the aria2-next `aria2-next.exe` binary for Windows. It is statically linked for portable use and keeps the aria2 command-line and RPC interfaces intact.

The official release binary is checked before packaging so it does not require MinGW, LLVM, OpenSSL, or zlib DLLs next to `aria2-next.exe`.

Official Windows releases use OpenSSL for HTTPS verification. The configured CA bundle fallback is built into the release path, so no extra DLLs are required next to `aria2-next.exe`.

Maintained dependency and Windows ARM64 llvm-mingw versions are recorded in `packaging/dependencies.env` in the source tree.

Example use from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\aria2-next.exe --version
.\aria2-next.exe https://example.com/file.iso
```

`--daemon` is not supported on Windows. Use a service manager, scheduler, or parent application when background process management is required.
