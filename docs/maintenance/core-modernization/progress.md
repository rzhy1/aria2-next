# Core Modernization Progress

This file is the compact chronological evidence trail for core modernization.
Keep entries checkpoint-sized. Do not record raw logs, packet captures,
generated reports, local public-network data, temporary downloads, local
caches, API payloads, or conversation text.

Use this format:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD CM-XXX status
Changed: concise tracker, code, or behavior summary.
Verified: exact final command and result, or documentation-only reason.
Remaining: next concrete gap.
Blocked: none, or exact blocker.
```

## Current Baseline

The completed `docs/maintenance/libtorrent-bt-migration` tracker is the
BitTorrent baseline. BitTorrent is owned by libtorrent-rasterbar and native
BitTorrent fallback is not allowed.

The completed `docs/maintenance/ed2k-refactor` and
`docs/maintenance/ed2k-download-hardening` trackers are the ED2K baseline.
ED2K remains native because no suitable maintained embeddable replacement
library has been identified. Future modernization should move ED2K onto modern
shared runtime, storage, crypto, and compression boundaries where practical
without reopening the protocol implementation as a wholesale replacement.

Current source inventory shows large remaining native or legacy areas:
HTTP/RPC/WebSocket, FTP/SFTP/SSH, network runtime, Metalink/XML, disk and
piece storage, crypto/compression, and core orchestration. These areas are the
scope of this tracker.

## Log

2026-05-23 CM-001 verified
Changed: Created the core modernization tracker with a no-fallback
modernization contract, library-first policy, removal policy, 99 percent
completion policy, focused test policy, roadmap, capability ledger, dependency
ledger, progress log, maintainer-selected final smoke fixtures, and nineteen
checkpoint matrices. Updated the maintenance root index to point to the new
tracker.
Verified: CSV parser check passed for 22 files. `git diff --check
docs/maintenance/README.md docs/maintenance/core-modernization` passed.
Remaining: Start CM-002 dependency policy when implementation begins.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-002 verified
Changed: Promoted the dependency policy checkpoint from pending to verified.
Recorded the selected target dependency set, explicit legacy dependency removal
set, retained native ED2K and storage ownership, packaging dependency version
source, and the boundary that actual source and packaging removals start in
later implementation checkpoints.
Verified: Current evidence was read from AGENTS.md, overview.md, roadmap.csv,
capability-ledger.csv, dependency-ledger.csv, the CM-002 checkpoint file, prior
libtorrent and ED2K tracker overviews, CMakeLists.txt, cmake/modules,
cmake/Sources.cmake, cmake/TestSources.cmake, packaging/dependencies.env, and
README.md. The tracker records that legacy CMake options, source lists, README
claims, and packaging dependencies still exist before CM-003+ migration work.
Remaining: Start CM-003 build baseline.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-003 verified
Changed: Raised the project build baseline to C++17, added required CMake gates
for libcurl, Boost.JSON, OpenSSL for SSL, zlib when enabled, and
libtorrent-rasterbar for BitTorrent, linked aria2_core against the target
dependency set, removed obsolete WinTLS, GnuTLS, nettle, GMP, libgcrypt, and
GnuTLS policy build switches and generated-config defines, and updated README
build option and TLS wording.
Verified: `cmake --preset default` passed and reported SSL=1, OpenSSL=1,
libcurl=1, Boost.JSON=1, BitTorrent=1, and libtorrent-rasterbar=1.
`cmake --build --preset default` passed and linked aria2-next and aria2_tests.
Stale build-option scan over cmake/modules, cmake/config.h.cmake.in, and
README.md found no removed WinTLS/GnuTLS/nettle/GMP/libgcrypt option or
generated-config names.
Remaining: Start CM-004 runtime foundation.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-004 verified
Changed: Added `AsioRuntime` as the Boost.Asio runtime owner for posted tasks,
timers, wake requests, cancellation, and shutdown wake bridging. DownloadEngine
now owns the runtime, drains ready work around the legacy EventPoll bridge,
wakes the runtime on graceful and force halt, and consumes wake requests after
forcing one non-blocking poll. Recorded the old EventPoll deletion plan for the
post-protocol-migration cleanup boundary.
Verified: `cmake --preset default` passed. `cmake --build --preset default`
passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::DownloadEngineTest'`
passed with 4 tests. CSV parser check passed for 22 tracker files. `git diff
--check` passed.
Remaining: Start CM-005 libcurl transfer foundation.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-005 verified
Changed: Added CurlSession as the libcurl multi owner with socket and timer
callbacks bridged through DownloadEngine. Added CurlDownloadCommand for the
first ordinary URL transfer path. HTTP/HTTPS initiation now routes to the curl
command while FTP/SFTP remain deferred. The curl data callback writes through
existing PieceStorage, SegmentMan, and DiskAdaptor boundaries, and completion
uses existing RequestGroup state.
Verified: `cmake --preset default` passed. `cmake --build --preset default`
passed. `build/default/aria2_tests
'All Tests/aria2::RequestGroupTest/aria2::RequestGroupTest::testInitiateConnectionFactoryUsesCurlForHttp'`
passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::DownloadEngineTest'`
passed with 4 tests. Local HTTP smoke under
`/Users/sekiro/Desktop/aria2-next-current/cm005-curl-smoke` exited 0 and
downloaded `curl-smoke-ok`. CSV parser check passed for 22 tracker files. `git
diff --check` passed.
Remaining: Start CM-006 HTTP and HTTPS feature migration.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-006 verified
Changed: Expanded `CurlDownloadCommand` into the HTTP/HTTPS transfer owner for metadata probing, request option mapping, known-length storage setup, range requests, resume, unknown-length fallback, and libcurl error surfacing. Removed direct native HTTP initiation from the command factory and deleted `HttpInitiateConnectionCommand`; retained the remaining old HTTP helper graph only where FTP proxy and RPC server cleanup still own it in later checkpoints.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::RequestGroupTest/aria2::RequestGroupTest::testInitiateConnectionFactoryUsesCurlForHttp'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::DownloadEngineTest'` passed. Local smokes under `/Users/sekiro/Desktop/aria2-next-current/cm006-final-smoke` verified HEAD metadata, byte-range GETs, resume-only missing ranges, and unknown-length fallback; earlier CM-006 smokes verified option propagation and 404 failure surfacing. CSV parser check passed for 22 tracker files. `git diff --check` passed.
Remaining: Start CM-007 FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and SCP migration through libcurl, then remove native FTP/SFTP and the temporary FTP proxy HTTP helper dependencies.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-007 verified
Changed: Migrated FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and SCP initiation to `CurlDownloadCommand`. `CurlDownloadCommand` now maps FTP-family credentials, active/passive FTP mode, ASCII transfer mode, FTPS SSL ownership, SFTP/SCP private-key option, libcurl protocol allowlists, and libcurl-reported metadata length. Removed native FTP/SFTP command graphs, `SSHSession`, direct SocketCore SSH hooks, Platform libssh2 lifecycle, direct libssh2 CMake option/linkage, and the obsolete `FtpConnectionTest` parser fixture.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::RequestGroupTest/aria2::RequestGroupTest::testInitiateConnectionFactoryUsesCurlForFtpFamily'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::ProtocolDetectorTest/aria2::ProtocolDetectorTest::testIsStreamProtocol'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::FeatureConfigTest'` passed. Stale scans over src, tests, cmake, README.md, and tracker files found no direct FTP/SFTP/libssh2 source residue outside tracker records.
Remaining: Start CM-008 cookie, auth, proxy, and netrc cleanup.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-008 verified
Changed: Moved client auth, cookie, netrc, and proxy ownership to libcurl. `CurlDownloadCommand` now maps HTTP credentials, FTP-family credentials, libcurl cookie file load/save, netrc, proxy URI, no-proxy, tunnel mode, and proxy credentials. Removed native CookieStorage, Cookie, cookie_helper, NsCookieParser, Sqlite3CookieParser, Netrc, AuthConfig/AuthResolver, client HttpRequest/HttpResponse/HttpConnection, client proxy helper graphs, obsolete options `http-auth-challenge`, `ftp-reuse-connection`, and `ssh-host-key-md`, stale internal tests, and SQLite build and packaging ownership.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default` passed. Focused RequestGroup curl routing tests passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::FeatureConfigTest'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::OptionHandlerTest'` passed. `git diff --check` passed. Packaging syntax checks passed for release workflow, CI workflow, and Docker release files. CSV parser check passed for 22 tracker files. Stale scans found no removed source files, SQLite ownership, removed options, or deleted client auth/cookie/proxy symbol ownership in active source, tests, CMake, README, workflows, or packaging.
Remaining: Start CM-009 Boost.Beast JSON-RPC HTTP server.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 CM-009 verified
Changed: Replaced the native JSON-RPC HTTP server command chain with Boost.Beast transport on the Asio runtime. Added `RpcBeastServer`, `RpcBeastSession`, `RpcHttpHandler`, and `AsioPumpCommand`; wired RPC startup through Beast; pruned deprecated `rpc-user`, `rpc-passwd`, `rpc-secure`, `rpc-certificate`, and `rpc-private-key`; deleted native `HttpServer*`, `HttpListenCommand`, `AbstractHttpServerResponseCommand`, `WebSocketResponseCommand`, and `HttpServerTest`.
Verified: `cmake --build --preset default` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::RpcHttpHandlerTest'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::rpc::RpcMethodTest/aria2::rpc::RpcMethodTest::testAuthorize'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::rpc::RpcMethodTest/aria2::rpc::RpcMethodTest::testSystemMulticall'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::DownloadEngineTest'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::OptionHandlerTest'` passed. `build/default/aria2_tests 'All Tests/aria2::FeatureConfigTest'` passed. Local Beast JSON-RPC smoke under `/Users/sekiro/Desktop/aria2-next-current/cm009-rpc-smoke` returned `aria2.getVersion` through HTTP POST with `rpc-secret`. Stale scans for removed native HTTP server files and pruned RPC options passed. CSV parser check passed for 22 tracker files. `git diff --check` passed.
Remaining: Start CM-010 Boost.Beast WebSocket transport.
Blocked: none.
