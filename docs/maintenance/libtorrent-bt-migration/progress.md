# Libtorrent BitTorrent Replacement Progress

This file is the compact chronological evidence trail for the libtorrent
BitTorrent replacement. Keep entries checkpoint-sized. Do not record raw logs,
packet captures, generated reports, local public-network data, or conversation
text.

Use this format:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD BTM-XXX status
Changed: concise tracker, code, or behavior summary.
Verified: exact final command and result, or documentation-only reason.
Remaining: next concrete gap.
Blocked: none, or exact blocker.
```

## Log

2026-05-23 BTM-001 active
Changed: Created the libtorrent BitTorrent replacement tracker with continuous
checkpoint numbering, a no-fallback migration contract, capability decisions,
focused test policy, native BitTorrent cleanup rules, and a separate
non-BitTorrent stall-fix checkpoint.
Verified: Documentation setup pending local format checks.
Remaining: Finish BTM-001 documentation verification, then start BTM-002
dependency and build integration.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-002 verified
Changed: Added a CMake dependency gate for libtorrent-rasterbar when
`ARIA2_ENABLE_BITTORRENT=ON`, exported `HAVE_LIBTORRENT_RASTERBAR`, linked
`aria2_core` to the pkg-config target and Boost headers, raised the project
C++ boundary to C++14, and added the dependency to the feature summary. This
moves the build boundary away from the old native BitTorrent engine by making
BitTorrent support require libtorrent-rasterbar.
Verified: Before the change, `cmake -S . -B build/libtorrent-gate-red -G Ninja
-DARIA2_ENABLE_BITTORRENT=ON` configured successfully without
libtorrent-rasterbar. After the change, `cmake -S . -B
build/libtorrent-gate-green -G Ninja -DARIA2_ENABLE_BITTORRENT=ON` failed with
`BitTorrent support now requires libtorrent-rasterbar`. `cmake -S . -B
build/no-bt-gate -G Ninja -DARIA2_ENABLE_BITTORRENT=OFF` succeeded and reported
`BitTorrent=; libtorrent-rasterbar=`. With libtorrent-rasterbar 2.0.12 and
Boost installed, `cmake -S . -B build/libtorrent-positive -G Ninja
-DARIA2_ENABLE_BITTORRENT=ON` configured with `libtorrent-rasterbar=1`, and
`cmake --build build/libtorrent-positive --target aria2_tests -- -j2` linked
the test executable. Direct header probes showed C++11 fails and C++14
compiles when Boost headers are available.
Remaining: Release dependency closure remains for BTM-010.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-003 verified
Changed: Added `LibtorrentAttribute` as the new BitTorrent request boundary,
added `CTX_ATTR_LIBTORRENT`, routed torrent files, torrent data, magnet links,
CLI/RPC addTorrent, and URI torrent detection into libtorrent-backed request
groups, stopped attaching the old `CTX_ATTR_BT` at ingress, and removed stale
native metadata post-handler tests from the active test target.
Verified: `build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1136)`.
Remaining: Implement BTM-004 libtorrent session ownership, alert polling,
torrent handle lifecycle, and engine wakeups.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-004 verified
Changed: Added `LibtorrentSession` as the DownloadEngine-owned session holder,
added `LibtorrentCommand` for add_torrent, alert polling, metadata shape
refresh, progress updates, and lifecycle shutdown, and routed
`CTX_ATTR_LIBTORRENT` request groups to the libtorrent command path before the
old native `CTX_ATTR_BT` branch.
Verified: `cmake --build build/libtorrent-positive --target aria2_tests -- -j2`
succeeded. `build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1138)`.
`git diff --check CMakeLists.txt cmake src tests
docs/maintenance/libtorrent-bt-migration` passed. CSV parser check over
`docs/maintenance/libtorrent-bt-migration/**/*.csv` passed with `CSV OK 13`.
Remaining: Start BTM-005 status, RPC, console, verified progress, and
false-completion cleanup.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-005 verified
Changed: Added libtorrent status storage to `LibtorrentAttribute`, updated
`LibtorrentCommand` to refresh verified libtorrent total, completed, upload,
speed, connection, info-hash, bitfield, seeding, and metadata state, and made
`RequestGroup` and RPC progress read libtorrent status before native
`PieceStorage` for libtorrent-backed downloads.
Verified: `testLibtorrentVerifiedProgressOverridesPieceStorage` covers the BT
false-completion path where old PieceStorage is marked complete but libtorrent
reports incomplete. `testGatherProgressLibtorrentStatus` covers RPC status
fields sourced from libtorrent. `build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed
with `OK (1140)`. `git diff --check CMakeLists.txt cmake src tests
docs/maintenance/libtorrent-bt-migration` passed. CSV parser check passed with
`CSV OK 13`.
Public smoke under `/Users/sekiro/Desktop/aria2-next-current` completed the
Debian netinst torrent, returned an empty active RPC result after completion,
and removed the `.aria2` control file.
Remaining: Continue BTM-006 resume data and native BT persistence cleanup.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-006 active
Changed: Added libtorrent resume data storage to `LibtorrentAttribute`, added a
libtorrent-specific `.aria2` control file that stores libtorrent fast-resume
data instead of native BT in-flight pieces, loads that data before adding the
torrent, and requests resume data on pause, shutdown, and completion while
waiting briefly for the async alert before removing the torrent.
Verified: `testLibtorrentResumeDataRoundTrip` covers the local resume data
round trip. Public Debian netinst smoke saved
`downloads/debian-netinst.torrent.aria2` after interrupt, loaded it on restart,
advanced from 304611328 bytes to 562036736 bytes, then completed 791674880
bytes and removed the control file. `cmake --build build/libtorrent-positive
--target aria2_tests -- -j2 && build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed
with `OK (1141)`.
Remaining: Run magnet-metadata smoke when practical, then remove obsolete
native BT progress persistence in BTM-006.3 or BTM-008.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-007 active
Changed: Added GID-indexed libtorrent torrent-handle tracking, mapped active
per-download download limit, upload limit, and maximum peer changes to the
libtorrent handle, applied stored group options when the torrent is added, and
kept option-only updates from creating an unused libtorrent session.
Verified: `testLibtorrentSessionTracksActiveTorrent`,
`testChangeOption`, `All Tests/aria2::rpc::RpcMethodTest`, and
`All Tests/aria2::RequestGroupTest` passed. `cmake --build
build/libtorrent-positive --target aria2_tests -- -j2` succeeded.
`build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1142)`.
`git diff --check CMakeLists.txt cmake src tests
docs/maintenance/libtorrent-bt-migration` passed. CSV parser check passed with
`CSV OK 13`.
Remaining: Map file priorities, pause/resume/remove details, and seed ratio or
seed time policy before closing BTM-007.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-007 active
Changed: Mapped `--select-file` and RPC `select-file` changes to libtorrent
file priorities. Torrent-file requests derive priorities before `add_torrent`,
runtime RPC changes update stored priorities, and metadata refresh applies
stored priorities once metadata exists.
Verified: `testCreateRequestGroupForUri_LibtorrentTorrentSelectFile`,
`testChangeOptionLibtorrentSelectFile`, `All Tests/aria2::DownloadHelperTest`,
`All Tests/aria2::rpc::RpcMethodTest`, and
`All Tests/aria2::RequestGroupTest` passed.
`build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1144)`.
Remaining: Map pause/resume/remove details and seed ratio or seed time policy
before closing BTM-007.
Blocked: none.

2026-05-23 BTM-007 verified
Changed: Added libtorrent seed-policy mapping for `--seed-time` and `--seed-ratio`, kept selected-file completion separate from full-torrent seeding, routed `on-bt-download-complete` through the libtorrent command path once per download, and made `RequestGroup::allDownloadFinished()` use libtorrent seeding status for migrated BT downloads.
Verified: `testStopsWhenSeedTimeElapsed`, `testStopsWhenShareRatioReached`, `testKeepsSeedingWhenRatioDisabled`, and `testLibtorrentAllDownloadFinishedUsesSeedingStatus` cover the new behavior. `build/libtorrent-positive/aria2_tests` passed with `OK (1148)`. `git diff --check CMakeLists.txt cmake src tests docs/maintenance/libtorrent-bt-migration` passed. CSV parser check passed with `CSV OK 13`.
Remaining: Start BTM-008 native BitTorrent cleanup and obsolete test removal.
Blocked: none.
